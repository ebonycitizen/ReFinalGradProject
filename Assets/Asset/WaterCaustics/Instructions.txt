DESCRIPTION:

Use this shader with Unity's Projector component to produce a "water caustics" effect.

RESOURCES INCLUDED: 

* CausticsDistort.shader
* CausticsDistortAlpha.shader
* CausticsDistortMobile.shader
* caustic_custom.bmp
* caustic_noise.bmp

The unitypackage file also includes a Prefab and Material with default settings.

HOW TO USE:

Import the custom package into Unity. Drag the prefab into your scene and adjust the projector component settings and shader material properties to fit your scene!
Textures are included for convenience, use any textures you want.  Make sure the texture's Import Settings are set to "Repeat".  Don't forget to set texture "tiling" properties on the material.

Updates 2019-11-17
- New version uses existing "_DepthBlend" property and mip-maps to produce a height/depth blur effect.
- Includes a Mobile version tested on Android, which uses SinTime for improved results.
- New "_DepthFade" property for better control over _DepthBlend effect.

Updates 2019-02-20
- Added an "alpha" version of the shader for masking. 
- Changed a couple variable types to improve precision on mobile.

Updates 2018-10-10
- Improved "Caustic" and "Noise" texture.
- Added a "dual texture blend" option. (This is a duplicate of the main texture that scrolls in the opposite direction)
- Replaced "Size" variable with standard texture tiling properties. ("Offset" has no affect)
- Improved "DepthBlend" transition.
- New "Distance" and "DistanceBlend" variables fade out the effect based on distance from camera.

Made with Unity 5.6.5, also tested successfully in Unity 2018 and 2019. The projector is broken in Unity 5.3.x [www.unity3d.com]
